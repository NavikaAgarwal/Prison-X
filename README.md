# Prison X
We initiated and carried out this project as part of a mini-project assignment for my college during the fifth semester.

## Overview

Prison X is an e-portal designed to streamline and improve the management of undertrial prisoners. This platform aims to facilitate communication, documentation, and overall efficiency in the handling of undertrial cases within the prison system.
